				<h4>Harsh Patel</h4>
				<div class="bio">
					<p>
						Harsh Patel (b. Nairobi) is a graphic designer based in Los Angeles. "I formed my independent practice in the 'post 9/11' arena, after earning my BFA in design from the University of Texas, Austin. As an immigrant from a working background, communicating my experiences and values has always been the core of a tenable professional life. I believe that design studies should more clearly reflect globalization's broadening critical spectrum. The continuous blurring of lines dividing visual communication, commercial design, and what's deemed art requires a more accessible academic dialogue that is fluent in issues of responsible representation."

						So begins Fuzz Box Vol. 2 No. 5, a zine edited by Nicolas Jenkins in Montreal at the height of the queer anarcho-punk scene of the late ’80s and early ’90s. In an era shaped by the AIDS epidemic and its ensuing culture wars, violences, and oppressions, zinesters waged queerness as a weapon against bigotry and boredom. Join Nat Pyper for an erotic close reading and page-turning performance of Fuzz Box, the At War issue: an intimate encounter between publishing and desire.

				<h4>Eli Cumings</h4>
				<div class="description">
					<p>
						In sixteenth-century Europe, interest in so-called ‘monstrous births’ was rife. Infants with congenital abnormalities were displayed at fairs, outside churches and in their homes. The causes of their physical deviance were considered in medical and ethnographical works, as well as sermons, autobiographies, and a host of other texts. The tradition of interpreting infants in this way was, of course, not new. But in the early modern period, the discourse entered print for the first time. In this lecture I will reflect upon the consequences of this material fact, focussing my discussion on a small group of ‘broadsides’: cheap, mass-produced, single-sheet texts which were intended for a general readership. How did these texts articulate and transmit ideologies of bodily difference? What was the relationship between their form and content? How did they shape public notions of normalcy and deviance?
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="bio">
					<p>
						Eli Cumings is a doctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge. Her work explores the representation of bodily difference in the textual culture of the Protestant Reformation, using the notion of ‘monstrosity’ as the point of departure. She is currently based in Berlin, where she will shortly begin a DAAD-funded research project.

					GRAPHIC DESIGN CONFABULATIONS is presented by the <a href="eka-gd-ma.ee">MA in Graphic Design</a> program at the Estonian Academy of Arts, curated by Rosen Eveleigh, and generously supported by the CIRRUS Nordic-Baltic Network of Art and Design Education, and Nordplus.
				</p>
				<p>
					A series of speakers taking an oblique look onto graphic design and its outlines in order to re-think, destabilize or decenter its normative structures and practices. By prioritising that which has taken place in the margins, ephemerally, despite oppression and in dissent, we will seek to widen the circumference of design practice. To see where else design has and can happen; how social and political movements have manifested in visual cultures; and ultimately to develop a sense of self-reflexivity toward our own privileges and positions.
