                Taking the lead from Fred Moten and Harney’s criticism of academia and call for dissident forms of knowledge production, this presentation will explore the lives and the work of a group of 20th century figures that enacted forms of fugitivity avant-la-lettre. We will adopt a notion of fugitivity intended both as a breaching of the institutional frame, as well as a desire to trespass the boundaries between theory and practice, different media, literary genres and ultimately art and politics. We will first examine how critic Carla Lonzi’s decision to leave the artworld and embrace separatist feminism, was paralleled by a transfiguration of her mode of writing, aimed at challenging the artifice of language. We will then move to the erratic literary production of 70s gay activist Mario Mieli, which we will examine in light of his political attempt to replace identity with a world of erotic abundance.

            <p class="bio captioned" alt="Biography of Luisa Lorenza Corna">
                Luisa Lorenza Corna is an art and design historian teaching at Middlesex University. Her main areas of research are art, Marxism and feminism. She has written for various art and design magazines, amongst which Texte Zur Kunst, Art Monthly, Flash Art and Domus. She is completing an anthology of writings of the feminist art historian Carla Lonzi for Seagull. Her first monograph, tentatively titled Fugitivity and Militancy in Post-War Criticism, seeks to question the epistemological constraints of art history and academia, through recounting the lives and the works of a selection on critics that left the artworld in favour of direct political activity or independent pedagogical projects.

                Walking along a the uneven accountabilities of trans* feminist technoscience and critical pedagogy: Feeling out T*FTS (Trans*FeministTechnoScience) will be a lecture based in a not emerged (non-linear and between) timeline. Based in queer theory, trans* studies, feminist technoscience and disability justice the lecture will be a remixing of different theoretical texts and artistic and design projects that have impacted me as an artist and researcher. Feelings will be prioritised and omissions are promised.

                    <li>Maria :  Could you speak a bit more about your relationship to language? By manifesting accessibility within language (ie using the gender star asterisk) isn't there a risk of making the language itself inaccessible to wider audiences?</li>
                    <li>lisa :  hi! thx so much. how do you feel working in institutionalized contexts, where often critical pedagogy, disability justice, trans*feminist practice etc. are not really included and often very limited?</li>
                    <li>marje :  what are your thought about hacker community in general? do you feel you're part of the community?</li>
                    <li>helenslug :  thanks I really enjoyed the talk and also moving back and forth between the different versions/versionings :). I wanted to pick up on the work on hacking concrete and disability justice that you shared.. and I guess I wanted to ask does justice shape shift or not and does it ever need hacking for its concreteness or not?</li>
                    <li>guest_9244 :  Thanks so much for your talk and your thoughts! Loved the format of the talk! My question is: Education has so drastically changed within the past year. How do you tackle the difficulties of „online teaching“ within your pedagogical practice?</li>
                    <li>michael :  Curious if you could maybe extrapolate or provide insight into how speculative practices/discussions/actions can become more intersectional, accessible. How can these contemplations become less "scary" or softened for greater access, representation? PS: Hackers is suuuuch a great movie!!</li>
                    <li>helenslug : thanks Loren! I really like your articulation of justice shape shifting in contexts, and no I'm not suggesting that you suggest justice is concrete, instead I feel you are saying that its not.. and want to hear more of how you think on this! and also because of the ways maybe some ways academic uses justice tries to make it concrete somehow!</li>

                    <li>lisa : + could you repeat the name of the group you just mentioned?</li>
                    <li>Rosen : Posted 9 months, 2 weeks ago @lisa SINS INVALID and design justice network</li>
                    <li>isi :  I liked this article on differences btw disability justice and disability rights: https://www.marieclaire.com/politics/a35866693/lydia-x-z-brown-interview-2021/ - these could also have different states of matter, be concrete in different ways.</li>
                    <li>helenslug :  yes isi! and also concrete at different moments or concretising as a way to bring together different relations too</li>
                    <li>michael :  This was super refreshing and reaffirming! I hardly ever experience these conversations in this context and I'm really grateful for this discussion and for your facilitation, Loren (and Rosen)</li>
