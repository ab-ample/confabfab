                Taking the lead from Fred Moten and Harney’s criticism of academia and call for dissident forms of knowledge production, this presentation will explore the lives and the work of a group of 20th century figures that enacted forms of fugitivity avant-la-lettre. We will adopt a notion of fugitivity intended both as a breaching of the institutional frame, as well as a desire to trespass the boundaries between theory and practice, different media, literary genres and ultimately art and politics. We will first examine how critic Carla Lonzi’s decision to leave the artworld and embrace separatist feminism, was paralleled by a transfiguration of her mode of writing, aimed at challenging the artifice of language. We will then move to the erratic literary production of 70s gay activist Mario Mieli, which we will examine in light of his political attempt to replace identity with a world of erotic abundance.

                Luisa Lorenza Corna is an art and design historian teaching at Middlesex University. Her main areas of research are art, Marxism and feminism. She has written for various art and design magazines, amongst which Texte Zur Kunst, Art Monthly, Flash Art and Domus. She is completing an anthology of writings of the feminist art historian Carla Lonzi for Seagull. Her first monograph, tentatively titled Fugitivity and Militancy in Post-War Criticism, seeks to question the epistemological constraints of art history and academia, through recounting the lives and the works of a selection on critics that left the artworld in favour of direct political activity or independent pedagogical projects.

I wanted to pick up on the work on hacking concrete and disability justice that you shared.. and I guess I wanted to ask does justice shape shift or not and does it ever need hacking for its concreteness or not?</li>
                    <li>guest_9244 :  Thanks so much for your talk and your thoughts! Loved the format of the talk! My question is: Education has so drastically changed within the past year. How do you tackle the difficulties of „online teaching“ within your pedagogical practice?</li>
                    <li>michael :  Curious if you could maybe extrapolate or provide insight into how speculative practices/discussions/actions can become more intersectional, accessible. How can these contemplations become less "scary" or softened for greater access, representation? PS: Hackers is suuuuch a great movie!!</li>
                    <li>helenslug : thanks Loren! I really like your articulation of justice shape shifting in contexts, and no I'm not suggesting that you suggest justice is concrete, instead I feel you are saying that its not.. and want to hear more of how you think on this! and also because of the ways maybe some ways academic uses justice tries to make it concrete somehow!</li>

                    <li>isi :  I liked this article on differences btw disability justice and disability rights: https://www.marieclaire.com/politics/a35866693/lydia-x-z-brown-interview-2021/ - these could also have different states of matter, be concrete in different ways.</li>
                    <li>helenslug :  yes isi! and also concrete at different moments or concretising as a way to bring together different relations too</li>

            <p class="captioned" alt="description of the talk">
                In sixteenth-century Europe, interest in so-called ‘monstrous births’ was rife. Infants with congenital abnormalities were displayed at fairs, outside churches and in their homes. The causes of their physical deviance were considered in medical and ethnographical works, as well as sermons, autobiographies, and a host of other texts. The tradition of interpreting infants in this way was, of course, not new. But in the early modern period, the discourse entered print for the first time.
                <br><br>
                In this lecture I will reflect upon the consequences of this material fact, focussing my discussion on a small group of ‘broadsides’: cheap, mass-produced, single-sheet texts which were intended for a general readership. How did these texts articulate and transmit ideologies of bodily difference? What was the relationship between their form and content? How did they shape public notions of normalcy and deviance?

                Eli Cumings is a doctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge. Her work explores the representation of bodily difference in the textual culture of the Protestant Reformation, using the notion of ‘monstrosity’ as the point of departure. She is currently based in Berlin, where she will shortly begin a DAAD-funded research project.

                    <li>talah : Tyvm for the stimulating lecture Eli. I am particularly interested in the idea of the ‘spectral child’ - the idea that the birth broadsides diverted the viewer’s mind, if subliminally, to what was considered the ideal/‘complete’ body in the 16thc. Have you found similar spectres/diversions in the theological literature mentioned? It’s interesting to think about what isn’t said in this way.</li>
                    <li>grace : Thank you Eli! I have a q about the lives of the broadsheets as objects. Were they kept for long periods of time or more ephemeral? I'm guessing broadsheets in public places wouldn't have lasted long. I'm also interested in how these broadsheets ended up in museums + archives.</li>
                    <li>guest_5872 : how can this research be used to illuminate current tabloid commentary?</li>
                    <li>otttttt : from the perspective of graphic design: how were the broadsheets and/or printed matter perceived? at the moment they seem quite rough and cheap, but at the time were they perceived as something slick etc. perhaps the question is also did the fact that these broadsheets were printed add extra value / weight / authority to the text</li>

                So begins Fuzz Box Vol. 2 No. 5, a zine edited by Nicolas Jenkins in Montreal at the height of the queer anarcho-punk scene of the late ’80s and early ’90s. In an era shaped by the AIDS epidemic and its ensuing culture wars, violences, and oppressions, zinesters waged queerness as a weapon against bigotry and boredom. Join Nat Pyper for an erotic close reading and page-turning performance of Fuzz Box, the At War issue: an intimate encounter between publishing and desire.
