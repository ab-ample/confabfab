    <p>Welcome to our personal git blog 🎉</p>
    <h3>About Git and Github</h3>
    <p>Git is a version control system. Was created by Linus Torvals, the main developer and creator of Linux to facilitate collaboration between developers on large projects. <em>Github</em> is a commercial implementation of <em>Git</em>.</p>
    <span>What git/github can do?</span>
    <ol>
        <li>Track developments and changes in your documents</li>
        <li>Record the changes you made to your document in a way that you will be able to understand later</li>
        <li>Experiment with different versions of a document while maintaining the original version</li>
        <li>‘Merge’ two versions of a document and manage conflicts between versions</li>
        <li>Revert changes, moving ‘backwards’ through your history to previous versions of your document</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Git is also used by some designers as an alternative to track changes, experiment with new versions and avoid confusing file naming like: presentation_final.pdf, persentation_final2.pdf, presentation_def.pdf...</p>
    <h3>Git useful commands</h3>
    <h4>Add a change</h2>

        <li><em>git commit -m "commit title"</em> This command "commits" the changes on the files you have previously "staged".</li>
        <li><em>git push origin</em> This command uploads the changes/commits to the remote repository (Github).</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Update local repository</h4>
