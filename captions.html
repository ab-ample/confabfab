      <h3>Luisa Lorenza Corna</h3>
      <p class="captioned" alt="description text">
        Taking the lead from Fred Moten and Harney’s criticism of academia and call for dissident forms of knowledge production, this presentation will explore the lives and the work of a group of 20th century figures that enacted forms of fugitivity avant-la-lettre. We will adopt a notion of fugitivity intended both as a breaching of the institutional frame, as well as a desire to trespass the boundaries between theory and practice, different media, literary genres and ultimately art and politics. We will first examine how critic Carla Lonzi’s decision to leave the artworld and embrace separatist feminism, was paralleled by a transfiguration of her mode of writing, aimed at challenging the artifice of language. We will then move to the erratic literary production of 70s gay activist Mario Mieli, which we will examine in light of his political attempt to replace identity with a world of erotic abundance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luisa Lorenza Corna is an art and design historian teaching at Middlesex University. Her main areas of research are art, Marxism and feminism. She has written for various art and design magazines, amongst which Texte Zur Kunst, Art Monthly, Flash Art and Domus. She is completing an anthology of writings of the feminist art historian Carla Lonzi for Seagull. Her first monograph, tentatively titled Fugitivity and Militancy in Post-War Criticism, seeks to question the epistemological constraints of art history and academia, through recounting the lives and the works of a selection on critics that left the artworld in favour of direct political activity or independent pedagogical projects.

            <strong>Safiya Noble:</strong> Thank you Roderic for that lovely invitation. You all really scored when you got him to come and be part of your team here. We miss him in LA, and he was a favorite of ours at UCLA, so really happy for you to be here. And so pleased to join you this afternoon and to be competing with not just the beautiful sunny, hot, winter day, which still is amazing to me after having spent thirteen years at the University of Illinois in Illinois, to come home and really enjoy my life thoroughly with these days.
          </p>
          <p>
            So thanks for having me. I thought today I would talk a bit about the forthcoming book, Algorithms of Oppression, and then also maybe leave a little bit of space for us to dialogue. So I’m going to move fairly quickly through some of this, just so that we have enough time to also stay engaged in conversation. I’m going to set even a timer for myself to warn me that we’re just about out of time. Alright.

        Walking along a the uneven accountabilities of trans* feminist technoscience and critical pedagogy: Feeling out T*FTS (Trans*FeministTechnoScience) will be a lecture based in a not emerged (non-linear and between) timeline. Based in queer theory, trans* studies, feminist technoscience and disability justice the lecture will be a remixing of different theoretical texts and artistic and design projects that have impacted me as an artist and researcher. Feelings will be prioritised and omissions are promised.

      <h2 class="captioned" alt="21 Apr 2021, 19h (EET)">Between Text and Object: Reading the ‘Monstrous Birth’ Broadsides</h2>
      <h3>Eli Cumings</h3>
      <p>
        In sixteenth-century Europe, interest in so-called ‘monstrous births’ was rife. Infants with congenital abnormalities were displayed at fairs, outside churches and in their homes. The causes of their physical deviance were considered in medical and ethnographical works, as well as sermons, autobiographies, and a host of other texts. The tradition of interpreting infants in this way was, of course, not new. But in the early modern period, the discourse entered print for the first time.
        In this lecture I will reflect upon the consequences of this material fact, focussing my discussion on a small group of ‘broadsides’: cheap, mass-produced, single-sheet texts which were intended for a general readership. How did these texts articulate and transmit ideologies of bodily difference? What was the relationship between their form and content? How did they shape public notions of normalcy and deviance? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Eli Cumings is a doctoral researcher at the University of Cambridge. Her work explores the representation of bodily difference in the textual culture of the Protestant Reformation, using the notion of ‘monstrosity’ as the point of departure. She is currently based in Berlin, where she will shortly begin a DAAD-funded research project.

      <p>
        Dr. Bess Williamson will share some key moments in historical and current practices of design that addresses disability. From origins in the post-World War II decades, to recent creative efforts, disabled people and their allies have identified the potential for design to align with ideas of social change and justice—but that this means confronting biases and resistance on local and global levels.

        Dr. Bess Williamson is Associate Professor of Design History at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago (USA), where she teaches courses in the history of modern design, object theories, and disability studies in art and design. She is author of Accessible America: A History of Disability and Design and co-editor of Making Disability Modern: Design Histories, published this summer.

      <h3>Amal Khalaf</h3>
      <p>
        Through listening moments, readings and sharing stories from projects developed over the last decade, we will think about how histories of radical pedagogy and practices of listening play a role in community practice and collective imagining. What are the ways that collective imagining can create alternative spaces for contesting power and advocating for new forms of relation? As an artist, organiser or designer how do you ground your practice in supporting collective desire? The challenge of including the arts and pedagogical practices meaningfully in research, organising and community initiatives is not new, but has grown more important in these crisis-ridden times. There is a need for more collaborative work embracing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research and action.

        Amal Khalaf is a curator and artist and currently Director of Programmes at Cubitt and Civic Curator at the Serpentine Galleries where she has worked on the Edgware Road Project since its inception in 2009.

      <h3>Silas Munro</h3>
      <p>
        In 1925, Alain LeRoy Locke was asked to be guest editor of an issue of Survey Graphic, the richly designed periodical covering sociological and political issues of the day. The issue, titled “Harlem: Mecca of the New Negro”, was Locke’s first publication wherein he connected an emerging generation of young black writers, poets, and artists, to what would be known as the Harlem Renaissance. The infamous issue became the basis for the seminal 1925 anthology The New Negro, which marked a shift from a focus on Black bodies to Black consciousness and Black thought.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following year, a collective of young, black, and some queer artists would write, design, and self-publish FIRE!!, a publication devoted to younger Negro artists. FIRE!! was conceived by Langston Hughes and Bruce Nugent, both of who had work featured in The New Negro. They enlisted Wallace Thurman to edit the publication, and commissioned other black artists to contribute to its pages. The magazine’s varied content contained diverse genres, including essay, design, illustration, plays, and poetry. Tragically, the headquarters of FIRE!! burned down after the completion of the first issue, but not before its content made equally fiery controversy.

          <p class="captioned" alt="description text">
            In this book talk drawn form Information Activism: A Queer History of Lesbian Media Technologies (Duke, 2020), I outline how lesbian feminists in the U.S. and Canada approached publishing as an information practice key to establishing a foundation for their movements, and building more livable lives for lesbians. Focusing on newsletters, bibliographies and indexes, I show how activists created and circulating information as a world-making process when access to information was otherwise precarious.

McKinney is interested in how queer social movements use digital technologies to build alternative information infrastructures. Their current research is on activist responses to early online content regulations; the intertwined histories of AIDS Activism and digital technologies; and the ways sexuality has been used to explain data and databases since the mid 20th century.
