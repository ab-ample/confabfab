    <p>A series of speakers taking an oblique look onto graphic design and its outlines in order to re-think, destabilize or decenter its normative structures and practices. By prioritising that which has taken place in the margins, ephemerally, despite oppression and in dissent, we will seek to widen the circumference of design practice. To see where else design has and can happen; how social and political movements have manifested in visual cultures; and ultimately to develop a sense of self-reflexivity toward our own privileges and positions.</p>

    <p>Rosen Eveleigh is a designer, writer and researcher working independently or with artists, archives, editors, cultural institutions and publishers to produce graphic identities, typefaces, websites, texts, talks, books and other works. She is interested in the historic and methodological relationship between graphic design and queer culture.</p>
